# pykinematics
``pykinematics`` is an open-source Python package for estimating hip kinematics using both novel Magnetic and Inertial 
Measurement Unit (MIMU) wearable sensors and existing Optical Motion Capture (OMC) algorithms. The novel MIMU algorithms 
have been validated against OMC, and include novel methods for estimating sensor-to-sensor relative orientation and 
sensor-to-segment alignment.

## Requirements

- Python >=3.6
- Numpy
- Scipy

## Installation

``pykinematics`` is not currently on PyPI. To install, run the following in the terminal:

```shell script
pip install git+https://github.com/M-SenseResearchGroup/pymotion
```
